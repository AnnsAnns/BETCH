# What is this?

This is a rewrite of the error code module that I maintained for [Robocop/Komet](https://github.com/reswitched/robocop-ng).

This rewrite features automatic scrapping of error codes, a better format for error codes and much more. It'll always only focus on error codes and on nothing else.
